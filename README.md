# RoboPi: A CI Tool for Building and Deploying Robot Operating Systems At Scale

A powerful tool for building, maintaining, and deploying customized robot operating systems at scale. RoboPi lets you version control your entire robot OS configuration and makes remote development a breeze.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Version-Controlled Robot OS**:
  - Define and track your entire robot environment in code
  - Reproducible builds through GitHub Actions
  - Easy rollback to previous configurations
  - Share and collaborate on robot setups

- **Remote Development Ready**:
  - Headless server images optimized for remote development
  - Pre-configured for robotics development
  - Automatic IP address notifications

- **Customizable Environment**:
  - Define exact package requirements
  - Pre-install robot-specific drivers and custom installation steps
  - Configure system services and boot sequences

- **Network Auto-configuration**: 
  - Automatic connection to enterprise/home WiFi networks
  - Fallback access point for direct connection
  - Email notifications with IP address upon boot

## ü§î Why Use RoboPi?

This tool solves common challenges in robotics development:

1. **Version Control**: Track your entire robot OS configuration in Git
2. **Remote Development Straight Out of the Box**: Pre-configured for remote development
3. **Reproducibility**: Rebuild your exact environment anytime
4. **Easy Deployment**: Deploy the same configuration to multiple robots

Perfect for developers who:
- Want a version-controlled robot environment
- Need reproducible development environments
- Want to avoid manual Pi configuration and prefer remote development
- Manage multiple robots with similar setups

> [!NOTE]
> Currently tested on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5. May not be compatible with Raspberry Pi Zero.

## üìù Quick Start Guide

### 1. Fork & Configure
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Set up required secrets in your fork:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `EMAIL_ADDRESS` | Where to send Pi's IP address |
| `ENTNETWORK_SSID` | Enterprise network name |
| `ENTNETWORK_IDENTITY` | Network username |
| `ENTNETWORK_PASSWORD` | Network password |
| `ENTNETWORK_PRIORITY` | Connection priority (>5 for enterprise) |

### 2. Build Your Image
1. Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Build Now!"
2. Configure your build:
   - Choose device model
   - Set hostname & credentials
   - Configure WiFi settings
3. Download the generated image

### 3. Deploy & Connect
1. Flash image to SD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Boot your Pi
3. Connect via:
   - Enterprise/Home network: Check email for IP
   - Fallback AP mode: Connect to Pi's network (IP: 10.0.0.200)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Customization Options
- **Package Management**: 
  - Define exact versions of required packages
  - Add custom repositories
  - Include robot-specific drivers and libraries

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Custom boot sequences
  - Service configurations
  - Network settings
  - Development tools

- **Build Process**:
  - Based on official Raspbian distribution
  - Automated through GitHub Actions
  - Reproducible builds with version control
  - Custom post-installation scripts support

### Network Behavior
- **Primary**: Connects to configured WiFi networks by priority
- **Fallback**: Creates access point (static IP: 10.0.0.200)
- **Notification**: Emails IP address when online

### Example Use Cases
- Research labs managing multiple test platforms or robots
- Robotics companies deploying a fleet of robots
- Educational institutions maintaining student robots for course projects
- Development teams needing consistent robot environments across multiple robots
